## Ticket File Format

Each ticket is a file in `backlog/TICKET-XXX.md` (use templates/TICKET-template.md)

## Priority Rules
- **P0** tickets must be completed before P1 tickets start
- **P1** tickets should be completed before P2 tickets
- Dependencies must be respected regardless of priority
- Critical path tickets always take precedence
