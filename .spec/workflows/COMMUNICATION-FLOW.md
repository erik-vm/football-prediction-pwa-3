# Agent Communication Flow

## Core Principle
Agents communicate through structured requests and responses. All important decisions are logged in ticket artifacts.

## Communication Hierarchy

```
                    +---------------+
                    |  HUMAN        | (only for deployment setup + UI mockups)
                    +-------+-------+
                            |
                    +-------v-------+
                    | ORCHESTRATOR  | (coordinates everything)
                    +-------+-------+
                            |
          +-----------------+------------------+
          |                 |                  |
   +------v------+  +------v------+  +--------v------+
   |   ANALYST   |  |  ARCHITECT  |  |  RESEARCHER   |
   |   (what)    |  |   (how)     |  |  (find info)  |
   +------+------+  +------+------+  +---------------+
          |                 |
          |     +-----------+--------------+
          |     |           |              |
   +------v-----v+  +------v----+  +------v----------+
   | BACKEND DEV  |  |FRONT DEV  |  | DB SPECIALIST   |
   |              |  |           |  |                 |
   +------+-------+  +------+---+  +-----------------+
          |                 |
          |     +-----------+
          |     |
   +------v-----v---------+
   | SECURITY ENGINEER     | (reviews auth/security aspects)
   +------+----------------+
          |
   +------v----------+
   | CODE REVIEWER    | (reviews quality/design)
   +------+-----------+
          |
   +------v----------+
   | QA ENGINEER      |
   +------+-----------+
          |
   +------v----------+
   | LEAD DEVELOPER   | (technical lead + git push)
   +------------------+
```

## Question Routing

| Agent has question about... | Ask this agent |
|----------------------------|----------------|
| What should the feature do? | Analyst |
| How should it be structured? | Architect |
| External API details? | Researcher |
| Database schema? | DB Specialist / Architect |
| Visual design? | UI Designer |
| Is this code correct? | Code Reviewer |
| Is this secure? Auth/CORS/secrets? | Security Engineer |
| Does this meet acceptance criteria? | QA Engineer |
| Can I push this code? | Lead Developer (via Orchestrator) |
| Is this in scope? | Analyst -> Orchestrator |
| Deployment config? | DevOps Engineer |

## Communication Loops

### 1. Clarification Loop
```
Agent detects ambiguity
  -> Writes question with context
  -> Routes to appropriate specialist
  -> Specialist responds with answer
  -> If answer changes scope -> Orchestrator updates plan
  -> Agent continues work
```

### 2. Development Loop
```
QA writes failing tests (from acceptance criteria)
  -> Developer receives tests + ticket
  -> Developer implements until tests pass
  -> Developer requests Code Review
  -> Code Reviewer reviews
  -> If APPROVED -> Lead Developer pushes
  -> If CHANGES REQUESTED -> Developer fixes -> re-review
  -> QA does final verification
  -> Ticket marked DONE
```

### 3. Bug Fix Loop
```
QA finds bug
  -> Creates bug report with reproduction steps
  -> Orchestrator assigns to relevant Developer
  -> Developer fixes and documents
  -> Developer requests re-review
  -> QA verifies fix
  -> If fixed -> Ticket updated
  -> If not fixed -> back to Developer
```

### 4. Research Loop
```
Any agent needs external information
  -> Sends RESEARCH REQUEST to Researcher
  -> Researcher investigates (web search, docs)
  -> Returns RESEARCH FINDINGS
  -> Requesting agent evaluates
  -> If sufficient -> continues work
  -> If insufficient -> refines request -> Researcher tries again
  -> Max 3 iterations -> escalate to Orchestrator
```

### 5. Architecture Decision Loop
```
Developer unsure about design
  -> Asks Architect with context + options
  -> Architect decides (or asks Analyst for requirements)
  -> Decision logged in ticket
  -> Developer implements per decision
```

### 6. Full-Stack Coordination
```
Backend Developer defines API contract
  -> Shares with Frontend Developer
  -> Both implement their side
  -> If contract needs change:
    -> Developer proposes change
    -> Architect approves/rejects
    -> Both developers update
```

## Inter-Agent Message Format

```
FROM: [Agent Role]
TO: [Agent Role]
TICKET: [TICKET-XXX]
TYPE: question | answer | request | report | approval
SUBJECT: [Brief description]
BODY: [Details]
URGENCY: blocking | important | informational
```

## Rules
1. Never skip the Code Review step
2. Never push without Lead Developer
3. Always log decisions that affect other tickets
4. If blocked for more than 3 attempts, escalate to Orchestrator
5. QA has final say on whether acceptance criteria are met
6. Architect has final say on technical decisions
7. Analyst has final say on business logic
